# Tragedy

Tragedy is a high-level Cassandra abstraction for Python.

## Tragedy's Data Model

To model your data in Tragedy, you define Models, Indexes and the relationships between them. A *Model* is a collection of data that can be accessed via a RowKey, and an *Index* is a 1-N mapping from one RowKey to one or more Models. A RowKey is just a unicode string. We usually use unique identifiers like usernames or email addresses for the RowKey. For Models that have no obvious unique identifier, we just let tragedy generate a UUID for us.

Here's an example:

	class Tweet(Model):
    	uuid    = RowKey(autogenerate=True) # generate a UUID for us.
    	message = StringField()    
    	author  = ForeignKey(foreign_class=User, mandatory=True)

Tweet is a Model specification. If we instantiate Tweet, we get a specific tweet that we can write to the database:

    new_tweet = Tweet(message="Twittering from tragedy!", author='merlin')
	new_tweet.save()

Tweet instances are referred to and accessed by a RowKey. Tweet's RowKey is named `uuid` and its value is (randomly) autogenerated on save. Object can only be retrieved from the datastore if their RowKey is known. Since Tweet's RowKey is random, we'll lose the Tweet if we don't keep a reference somehow. One way to do this, is to store the RowKey in an Index. Let's create an Index of all tweets a specific user posts:

	class TweetsSent(Index):
    	by_username = RowKey()
    	targetmodel = ForeignKey(foreign_class=Tweet, compare_with='TimeUUIDType')

	merlinIndex = TweetsSent(by_username='merlin')
	merlinIndex.append(new_tweet)
	merlinIndex.save()

TweetsSent is an abstract Index over Tweets, sorted by Cassandra's TimeUUIDType. merlinIndex is a specifc TweetsSent-Index for user 'merlin', as specified by the given RowKey during instantiation. Items can be added to an Index using the .append() method, and changes to them saved using the .save() method. If we lose track of an Index, we can, as long as we remember the Index's RowKey, load it again with the .load() method:

    tweets_by_user = TweetsSent(by_username='merlin').load()
	print tweets_by_user

The main difference between Index's and Models is that Index's keep track of an unlimited amount of unnamed data of the same kind (normally ForeignKeys), whereas a Model keeps track of a limited number of data that can be any mixture of types. Indexes are most often used to to help us find Data whose RowKey we've forgotten. Models can refer to Indexes using ForeignKeys, and Indexes can refer to both Models and (less often)  other Indexes. However only to one specific Model or Index Type per Index. The call above gives us a list of Tweets previously posted by user 'merlin', with their RowKeys correctly set. Since the Index only contains references, the actual tweet data hasn't been loaded yet. If we tried to work with those tweets, we'd see #MISSING# fields:

    [<Tweet 8649a1ca4ab843b9afa6cc954908ac04: {'message': '#MISSING#', 'author': '#MISSING#'}, ...]

To actually load the tweets we need to resolve them. Luckily Indexes have the .resolve() helper to make this easy:

	tweets_by_user.resolve()
	print tweets_by_user
	[<Tweet ced314748d574379a817e1a1c9149789: {'message': "some message", 'author': <User merlin: {'password': '#MISSING#'}>}>

Behind the scenes Index.resolve() almost works like calling Model.load() on all Tweets in the list. It's more efficient though, since it combines all required queries into one multiquery for faster processing. Now we've seen how to create tweets, store them, and find them again. If you want to see how you can distribute them to Followers, scroll down for a full twitter demonstration below.

That's about it for the basics. There's more stuff Tragedy can do for you, and the following example shows of some of them, like automatic validation that Tragedy and Cassandra agree on the Data Model.
